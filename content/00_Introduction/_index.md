# Accelerating Secure Data Transfer

---


Cloud storage services like AWS S3 provide durability, availability, manageability, and a few security features. With the rapid rise in volume of data, file storage services like S3 are logical choices for modern business requirements.

Even with all the benifits of S3, migrating data can time consuming and potentially expose your data to security risks. Meeting complaince standards and enforcing best security practices is a layered approach between the customer, AWS and Trusted AWS Security Partners like Trend Micro. 

While the cloud service provider (CSP) is responsible for the infrastructure, you the customer are responsible for the configurations and what you store within it. That means it’s your duty to detect and remediate any misconfigurations or malware.

In this workshop, you will migrate data to AWS securely, using:
- AWS S3 to provide durable storage as well as some features like server-side encryption, versioning, IAM techniques. 
- IBM® Aspera® to provide high-speed data transfers to migrate large amounts of data to S3.
- Trend Micro Cloud One™ File Storage Security to validate object for malware and maintain data sovereignty.
